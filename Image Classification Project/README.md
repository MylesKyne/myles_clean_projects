# Image Classification in MATLAB

This project implements an image classification system using MATLAB. It uses a custom or standard dataset and applies image processing techniques along with a classification model to label images correctly.

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization using MATLAB functions
- Feature extraction and classification using built-in toolboxes or custom logic
- Evaluation of classifier accuracy

## Technologies
- MATLAB (.m scripts)
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Machine Learning Toolbox (if used)

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main script:
   ```matlab
   main.m
