# NLP-Based Film Success Prediction

This project explores the use of large language models and rule-based methods to predict the success of films using metadata and NLP techniques. It compares the performance of fine-tuned LLMs like GPT-2, BERT, and Falcon against traditional heuristics.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuning with LoRA and PEFT for efficient memory use
- Data from IMDb and box office records
- Comparison between transformer models and logic-based prediction

## Tools & Technologies
Python, HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, Pandas
